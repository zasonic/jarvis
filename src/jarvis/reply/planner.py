"""Task-list planner for multi-step queries.

Small models (gemma4:e2b class) don't reliably plan tool use turn-by-turn.
They tend to: (a) stop after one tool call even when the query has two
distinct sub-questions, (b) skip tools entirely and confabulate from
training, or (c) feed the raw user utterance into a tool argument instead
of composing a proper query against dialogue context and enriched memory.

This module fixes that by running a single, cheap LLM pass at the top of
the reply flow that emits a short ordered list of sub-tasks. The engine
injects the plan into the system message and uses it to drive a
progress-aware nudge after each tool result — so the model always has a
concrete "what to do next" pointer instead of having to re-derive the
multi-step shape from scratch every turn.

Design principles:
- Fail-open: if planning fails or times out, return an empty list and
  let the engine fall through to existing behaviour.
- Cheap model chain: planner rides the router / intent-judge / chat model
  chain so it doesn't page in extra weights.
- Dual mode: for LARGE models the plan is advisory — injected into the
  system message so the chat model can follow it. For SMALL models
  (`use_text_tools=True`) the engine calls `resolve_next_tool_call` to
  convert each planned step into a concrete tool call and dispatches it
  directly, bypassing the chat model for intermediate turns. The chat
  model still runs once for the final synthesis step.
- Bounded: max 5 steps, single-clause strings, no nested JSON.
- Language-agnostic: the prompt instructs the planner to emit steps in
  the same language the user spoke.

# URL hygiene applied to resolved tool arguments.
#
# Background (2026-05 field trace, chrome-devtools__navigate_page):
# the planner LLM emitted `page='[youtube.com](http://youtube.com)'`
# (markdown link syntax leaked from training priors) and even when the
# resolver remapped the key to `url` the value retained the wrapper.
# Puppeteer's Page.navigate then rejected with "Cannot navigate to
# invalid URL". A separate failure mode is bare-domain values like
# `youtube.com` with no scheme — Page.navigate rejects those too.
#
# Two-stage normalisation closes both holes in one place:
#   1. Strip `[text](url)` markdown wrappers, keeping only the URL
#      portion. Tools should never receive markdown — it's never a
#      valid tool argument.
#   2. Prepend `https://` to scheme-less bare domains so URL-shaped
#      arguments always reach the tool as a fully-qualified URL.
#
# Scoped to keys whose name suggests a URL value to avoid stomping on
# unrelated string args (a `query='youtube.com tutorials'` step must
# stay literal). Keys are matched against a small allow-list of common
# URL-ish parameter names; this is generic enough to cover every MCP
# server we ship with and every tool we plan to add.

    "(fetching past-conversation memory, calling external tools) and in "
    "what order. Decompose the user's query into a short ordered list "
    "of concrete sub-tasks, one per line.\n\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "1. Each step is a single short imperative sentence (under 15 words).\n"
    "2. PERSONALISED queries ALWAYS need memory FIRST. A query is "
    "personalised when the answer depends on who the user is — their "
    "tastes, interests, history, habits, diet, preferences. The tell: "
    "swap 'me' for 'a random person' and the query stops making sense "
    "(e.g. 'news that might interest a random person' is incoherent; "
    "'what is the capital of France' is unchanged). For ANY such "
    "query, emit as the FIRST step: `searchMemory topic='<what to "
    "look up>'`. Linguistic triggers that ALL qualify: 'for me', "
    "'I'd like', 'I'd enjoy', 'interest me', 'suits me', "
    "'recommend … (to me / for me)', 'suggest …', 'what should I "
    "(watch/read/cook/do/eat/buy)', 'something I would'. YES-examples "
    "(MUST start with searchMemory): 'news that might interest me' → "
    "searchMemory topic='user interests'; 'what should I watch "
    "tonight' → searchMemory topic='films the user has engaged with'; "
    "'what should I cook for dinner' → searchMemory topic='user food "
    "preferences and dietary restrictions'; 'suggest something I'd "
    "enjoy watching' → searchMemory topic='user viewing tastes'. "
    "NO-examples (DO NOT emit searchMemory): 'who is Britney Spears', "
    "'what is the capital of France', 'what's the weather today', "
    "'search the web for Possessor 2020'. If no prior-conversation "
    "memory is needed, OMIT this step entirely — every extra "
    "searchMemory directive costs a real LLM call.\n"
    "3. Use external tools ONLY from the AVAILABLE TOOLS list below, "
    "by exact name. If no tool is needed (greeting, small-talk, "
    "opinion, a question about yourself, a fact already in the "
    "dialogue), DO NOT invent tool steps.\n"
    "4. When a step uses a tool, name it explicitly and give a concrete "
    "argument (e.g. `webSearch query='Possessor 2020 director'`).\n"
    "5. Compose tool arguments against the user's actual intent plus "
    "dialogue context — do NOT echo the raw user utterance. "
    "If the user did NOT explicitly supply a value for an optional "
    "argument, OMIT that argument — the tool uses sensible defaults "
    "(current location, current time, default unit). Do NOT fabricate "
    "a value by grabbing an unrelated word from the utterance: a word "
    "describing WHEN is not a location; a word describing WHO is not a "
    "query topic. When in doubt, emit the tool with no arguments.\n"
    "6. If the query depends on an earlier tool result (e.g. \"what other "
    "films has that director made\"), list the dependent step AFTER the "
    "lookup step it depends on. For entities the lookup will reveal, use "
    "an angle-bracket placeholder in the dependent step's argument — e.g. "
    "`webSearch query='films directed by <director name from step 1>'`. "
    "The main assistant will substitute the concrete value at execution "
    "time.\n"
    "7. Resolve pronouns and demonstratives ('he', 'she', 'they', "
    "'his', 'her', 'their', 'it', 'that', 'this', 'them') against "
    "DIALOGUE CONTEXT before writing the step. The named entity must "
    "appear LITERALLY in the tool argument — tools never see the "
    "dialogue, so a tool call like `webSearch query='his most famous "
    "songs'` is broken: the search engine has no idea who 'his' is. "
    "Example: dialogue mentions Harry Styles, user says 'what are his "
    "most famous songs?' → emit `webSearch query='Harry Styles most "
    "famous songs'`, NOT `webSearch query='his most famous songs'`. "
    "Same rule for 'that film', 'that book', 'her album' — substitute "
    "the concrete entity name from dialogue.\n"
    "8. Final step is always a synthesis/reply step when any "
    "searchMemory or tool steps were planned: "
    "`Reply to the user with the combined findings.`\n"
    "9. For trivial greetings, small-talk, opinions or questions the "
    "assistant can answer directly, emit a single step: "
    "`Reply to the user.`\n"
    "10. Maximum {max_steps} steps. Do not number them — one step per line.\n"
    "11. Output ONLY the steps, no preamble, no trailing commentary, no "
    "JSON fences, no explanations.\n"
