# LLM Contexts Map

Every distinct LLM call in Jarvis, what feeds it, what consumes it, and how it is gated. This is the reference for optimising the app's main bottleneck (LLM latency). Keep it in sync with the code — see the note at the bottom.

---

## 1. Main Reply Loop (agentic messages loop)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/reply/engine.py](src/jarvis/reply/engine.py) — `reply()` and the loop at ~lines 1370-1650; native tool-call path in `chat_with_messages()` (~1424, 1455).
- **Trigger**: every user message. Runs up to `agentic_max_turns` (default 8) iterations per reply.
- **Model / gating**: `cfg.ollama_chat_model` (the big model). Not optional. No size branching on the loop itself — size branching affects the digests/evaluator around it.
- **Inputs**:
  - Redacted user query
  - Recent dialogue (last 5 minutes), including in-loop tool-call + tool-role messages from prior replies within the active conversation (tool carryover, `DialogueMemory.record_tool_turn` / `get_recent_turns_with_tools` in [src/jarvis/memory/conversation.py](src/jarvis/memory/conversation.py); per-prompt cap via `cfg.tool_carryover_max_turns` / `tool_carryover_per_entry_chars`; storage cap `_tool_turns_max_storage = 16`; cleared on `stop` signal AND on new-conversation entry; UNTRUSTED WEB EXTRACT fence markers preserved on truncation; both `content` and `tool_calls[*].function.arguments` scrubbed on write)
  - Unified system prompt from [src/jarvis/system_prompt.py](src/jarvis/system_prompt.py) + ASR note + tool-protocol guidance
  - **Warm profile block** (query-agnostic User + Directives excerpt from the knowledge graph, composed by `build_warm_profile()` / `format_warm_profile_block()` in [src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py](src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py) at Step 3.5 of `reply()`; no LLM call, pure SQLite read; injected unconditionally so personalisation is the default; result cached in `DialogueMemory._hot_cache` under `DialogueMemory.WARM_PROFILE_CACHE_KEY` for the lifetime of the active conversation. Invalidated on `stop`, on new-conversation entry, AND on User/Directives graph mutations via the listener registered in [src/jarvis/daemon.py](src/jarvis/daemon.py) against `register_graph_mutation_listener` in [src/jarvis/memory/graph.py](src/jarvis/memory/graph.py); World-branch writes are ignored)
  - Digested memory enrichment (optional, see #4)
  - Time + location context (re-injected each turn)
  - Tool schema: native via `generate_tools_json_schema()` ([src/jarvis/tools/registry.py](src/jarvis/tools/registry.py)) or text fallback via `_text_tool_call_guidance()` ([engine.py:68](src/jarvis/reply/engine.py:68))
  - Tool results from prior turns (raw or digested — see #5)
- **Output**: OpenAI-style `{content, tool_calls, thinking}`. Consumed by the tool orchestrator and TTS pipeline. Natural-language content is delivered immediately; no post-turn evaluator runs.
- **Limits**: `num_ctx: 8192` (explicit). Timeout `llm_chat_timeout_sec` (45s). Auto-fallback from native to text tool-calls on HTTP 400 (`ToolsNotSupportedError`), sticky for the session. Risk: `fetch_web_page` truncates at 50,000 chars (~37k tokens) — mitigated for SMALL models by tool-result digest (#5) which compresses the payload before it enters the messages history. LARGE models receive the raw payload and may silently see a truncated context.

## 2. Intent Judge

- **File**: [src/jarvis/listening/intent_judge.py](src/jarvis/listening/intent_judge.py) — `IntentJudge.evaluate()`.
- **Trigger**: on a speech segment *only if* there is an engagement signal (wake word detected, hot-window active, or TTS playing). Pure ambient speech skips it.
- **Model / gating**: `cfg.intent_judge_model` (default `gemma4:e2b`, ~2B). Falls back to text-based wake detection if Ollama is unavailable.
- **Inputs**:
  - Rolling transcript buffer (last 120s, with timestamps)
  - Wake-word timestamp (if any), normalised aliases
  - Last TTS text + finish time (echo rejection)
  - State flags (wake_word_mode, hot_window_mode, during_tts)
- **System prompt**: `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` at [intent_judge.py:135](src/jarvis/listening/intent_judge.py:135). Teaches query extraction, echo detection, stop commands, pronoun/topic disambiguation, imperative re-addressing, declaratives to the wake word.
- **Output**: strict JSON `IntentJudgment{directed, query, stop, confidence, reasoning}` ([intent_judge.py:94](src/jarvis/listening/intent_judge.py:94)). Consumed by the listening state machine which dispatches to the reply engine.
- **Limits**: `intent_judge_timeout_sec` (15s). `num_ctx: 8192` (explicit — system prompt is ~2k tokens after PR #362, and the rolling transcript buffer at default `transcript_buffer_duration_sec=120` can reach ~1.5k tokens in chatty multi-speaker scenes; 4096 left ~10% headroom and risked silent ollama truncation of the system prompt's tail, where the few-shot examples and TRANSCRIPT NOISE block live).

## 3. Memory Enrichment Extractor

- **File**: [src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py](src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py) — `extract_search_params_for_memory()` (~line 71).
- **Trigger**: once per reply, **only when the pre-flight planner (#12) emitted a `searchMemory` directive or returned an empty plan (fail-open)**. Pure reply-only plans skip this entirely — saves one LLM call per greeting / small-talk turn.
- **Model / gating**: resolved via `resolve_tool_router_model(cfg)` — `tool_router_model → intent_judge_model → ollama_chat_model`. Small classification task; rides the same small/warm model as the router. Silent empty-dict on failure.
- **Inputs**: user query (with the planner's `topic` hint appended when present), optional context hint (live-context compact summary), UTC now.
- **System prompt**: inline at [enrichment.py:35-63](src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py:35).
- **Output**: `{keywords, from?, to?, questions?}`. Consumed by memory search in the reply engine.
- **Limits**: up to 2 retries; timeout from `llm_tools_timeout_sec`.
- **Caching**: result cached in `DialogueMemory._hot_cache` under key `enrichment:{redacted_query[+topic_hint]}` for the lifetime of the active conversation. Identical follow-ups within the same conversation reuse the dict and skip the LLM hop. Cleared by `clear_hot_cache()` on the `stop` signal and on new-conversation entry.

## 3b. Recall Gate (pre-enrichment short-circuit)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/memory/recall_gate.py](src/jarvis/memory/recall_gate.py) — `should_recall()`.
- **Trigger**: once per reply, before diary/graph/digest enrichment runs (after the planner has decided memory is potentially needed).
- **Model / gating**: NO LLM — deterministic keyword-coverage heuristic. Cheap.
- **Inputs**: query, recent dialogue (incl. tool carryover rows).
- **Output**: `False` only if hot-window contains a fresh tool result AND ≥50% of the query's content words appear in the hot-window transcript → skips diary, graph, and memory digest for this reply. Else `True`. Fail-open on any exception. Content-word extraction uses `\w{3,}` with `re.UNICODE`, so the gate works for Latin, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, etc. (per CLAUDE.md "no hardcoded language patterns"). Overlap words are run through `redact()` before being written to debug logs.
- **Planner precedence**: when the planner explicitly emitted a `searchMemory` step, the gate is bypassed — the planner has more signal than coverage and overriding it would silently drop intent. The gate only short-circuits the fail-open empty-plan path.
- **Rationale**: prevents re-running diary/graph lookups when the hot window already grounds the follow-up (e.g. "his most famous song" after a Bieber webSearch).

## 4. Memory Digest (optional, SMALL models)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py](src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py) — `digest_memory_for_query()` + `_distil_batch()`.
- **Trigger**: once per reply when enrichment returns hits AND `memory_digest_enabled` (default OFF; `null` = auto-ON for SMALL ≤7B / OFF for LARGE). Skipped if raw < `_DIGEST_MIN_CHARS` (400). Batched if raw > `_DIGEST_BATCH_MAX_CHARS` (2000).
- **Model / gating**: `ollama_chat_model`. Gated by `memory_digest_enabled`.
- **Inputs**: user query, raw diary entries, raw graph nodes.
- **System prompt**: `_DIGEST_SYSTEM_PROMPT` at [enrichment.py:122](src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py:122). Teaches relevance filtering, preference-signal detection, attribution preservation, `NONE` sentinel, identity queries.
- **Output**: ≤400 chars text per batch (`_DIGEST_MAX_CHARS`) injected as reference-only memory context into the main loop's system message. Empty on failure.
- **Limits**: `llm_digest_timeout_sec` (8s, shared).

## 5. Tool-Result Digest (optional, opt-in)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py](src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py) — `digest_tool_result_for_query()` + `_distil_tool_batch()`.
- **Trigger**: after each tool result in the loop, if `tool_result_digest_enabled` (default `null` = auto-ON for SMALL ≤7B, OFF for LARGE). Primary motivation on small models: prevents `fetch_web_page`'s 50k-char payloads from filling the 8192 num_ctx window. Skipped if raw < 400 chars (`_TOOL_DIGEST_MIN_CHARS`); batched if > 2500 (`_TOOL_DIGEST_BATCH_MAX_CHARS`).
- **Model / gating**: `ollama_chat_model`. Gated by `tool_result_digest_enabled`.
- **Inputs**: user query, tool name, raw tool result (e.g. webSearch payload inside UNTRUSTED WEB EXTRACT fence).
- **System prompt**: `_TOOL_DIGEST_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. Teaches attributed fact extraction, `NONE` sentinel, no inference.
- **Output**: ≤600 chars per batch (`_TOOL_DIGEST_MAX_CHARS`) replacing the raw payload in the messages stream. Falls back to raw on `NONE`.
- **Limits**: `llm_digest_timeout_sec` (8s, shared).

## 6. Max-Turn Loop Digest

- **File**: [src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py](src/jarvis/reply/enrichment.py) — `digest_loop_for_max_turns()` (~line 847).
- **Trigger**: when the loop exhausts `agentic_max_turns` without producing a natural-language reply (e.g. pure tool-call loop). The evaluator no longer drives this — termination on content is immediate.
- **Model / gating**: `_resolve_loop_digest_model(cfg)` — prefers `intent_judge_model`, falls back to `ollama_chat_model`.
- **Inputs**: user query + loop activity (tool calls, results summaries, any prose).
- **System prompt**: `_LOOP_DIGEST_SYSTEM_PROMPT` — caveat-prefixed, user-language, concise.
- **Output**: caveat-prefixed final reply. Fails open to the last raw candidate or generic error.
- **Limits**: `llm_digest_timeout_sec` (8s, shared).

## 7. Tool Router (pre-loop tool selection)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/tools/selection.py](src/jarvis/tools/selection.py) — `select_tools_with_llm()` (~line 331).
- **Trigger**: once per reply, **at the very front of the flow before the planner (#12)**. Always runs — the router is the authoritative tool picker, and its narrowed catalogue is what the planner sees. When the planner later references tools, those names are unioned into the router's allow-list but never replace it; small models tend to default to `webSearch` where a dedicated tool like `getWeather` should win, and the router is tuned for that classification. `tool_selection_strategy == "llm"` is the default; other strategies (`all`, `keyword`, `embedding`) also run here.
- **Model / gating**: `resolve_tool_router_model(cfg)` chain — `tool_router_model → intent_judge_model → ollama_chat_model`.
- **Inputs**: user query, tool catalogue (builtin + MCP with descriptions), optional narrow-down hint.
- **System prompt**: inline (~lines 260-315). Teaches pick up-to-5 tools or `none`.
- **Output**: comma-separated tool names or `none`. Capped at `_LLM_MAX_SELECTED` (5). Always-included tools (`stop`, `toolSearchTool`) are unioned in regardless.
- **Limits**: `llm_timeout_sec`. On failure → all tools.
- **Caching**: `routed_tools` cached in `DialogueMemory._hot_cache` under key `router:{redacted_query}|{strategy}|{builtin-names}|{mcp-names}` for the lifetime of the active conversation. The catalogue signature lets a mid-conversation MCP refresh invalidate the cache; `context_hint` is intentionally excluded so time/location drift inside one conversation doesn't bust it. Cleared by `clear_hot_cache()` on the `stop` signal and on new-conversation entry.
- **Carry-over guard (engine-side overlay)**: after the cache lookup/write, the engine inspects the previous assistant turn's tool calls. When a previous tool reported `success=False` on its `ToolExecutionResult` (read via the `tool_failed` flag stamped onto each recorded tool result), that tool name is unioned back into the local `routed_tools` for this turn only. Compensates for small routers that misroute follow-ups where the user is supplying missing info (e.g. "I'm in London" routing to `webSearch` after a stalled `getWeather` chain). Successful chains do not carry over — a genuine new short ask after a completed chain keeps the router pick clean. The augmentation never touches the cache; replays of the same query in future turns get the raw router output. See `src/jarvis/reply/reply.spec.md` §6 (Tool allow-list per turn) for the full contract.

## 8. Tool Searcher (mid-loop escape hatch)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/tools/builtin/tool_search.py](src/jarvis/tools/builtin/tool_search.py) — `toolSearchTool`.
- **Trigger**: when the model explicitly invokes `toolSearchTool` during the loop. Capped at `tool_search_max_calls` (3) per reply.
- **Model**: reuses the tool router (#7) — no separate LLM call here.
- **Inputs**: self-contained query from the model.
- **Output**: newline-separated tool names + one-liners, merged into the allow-list for the next turn.

## 9. Conversation Summariser

- **File**: [src/jarvis/memory/conversation.py](src/jarvis/memory/conversation.py) — `generate_conversation_summary()` (~lines 350/355).
- **Trigger**: background, periodic — when unsaved dialogue reaches `dialogue_memory_timeout`. One per day per `source_app`.
- **Model / gating**: `ollama_chat_model`. Respects `llm_thinking_enabled`. Uses streaming when a token callback is provided, else direct.
- **Inputs**: recent conversation chunks + prior same-day summary (for incremental update).
- **System prompt**: inline (~lines 310-320). Hygiene rules per [src/jarvis/memory/summariser.spec.md](src/jarvis/memory/summariser.spec.md): no deflection narration, attribution preservation, topic separation. ≤200 words + 3-5 topic keywords.
- **Output**: `(summary_text, topics_text)` → deterministic `scrub_deflection_sentences()` post-process (drops sentences that narrate assistant failures the prompt failed to suppress) → `conversation_summaries` table, embedded for vector search, feeds enrichment (#3) and graph extraction (#10). The scrub is also exposed as a one-shot bulk sweep `scrub_all_diary_summaries()` (`POST /api/diary/scrub-deflections`) for cleaning historical poisoning. Mirror of the graph's two-layer defence (extractor BANNED FACT FORMS at write-time, merge-time rewrite for historical data).
- **Topic optimisation (separate bulk op)**: `optimise_diary_topics()` (`POST /api/diary/optimise-topics`) — collects all unique tags from `conversation_summaries`, makes one `ollama_chat_model` call with `_TOPIC_OPTIMISE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to propose a normalised taxonomy (merge synonyms, split compound tags), then applies the mapping to every row that needs updating. Preserves `ts_utc`; re-embeds updated rows best-effort. User-triggered from the Maintenance section in the diary sidebar.
- **Limits**: `timeout_sec` (30s default).

## 10. Knowledge Graph Fact Extraction + Branch Classification

- **File**: [src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py](src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py) — `extract_graph_memories()`.
- **Trigger**: after each daily summary (#9). Background.
- **Model**: `ollama_chat_model`.
- **Inputs**: summary text + optional date.
- **System prompt**: inline — asks for JSON array of `{"branch": "USER|DIRECTIVES|WORLD", "fact": "..."}` objects, with a heuristic ("user telling the assistant how to behave → DIRECTIVES; user telling the assistant about themselves → USER; external facts → WORLD"). Unknown branches default to USER. The DO-NOT-EXTRACT block hardens two recurring traps: assistant-generated recommendations (would-a-different-assistant-give-the-same-answer? heuristic separates these from external lookups, which DO count as facts) and transient snapshots like the current weather / time of day (described as "moments not facts" so the model stops conflating ephemera with persistent climate / location knowledge).
- **Output**: list of `(branch_id, fact_text)` tuples → routed into the tagged branch via branch-pinned descent (no cross-branch contamination).
- **Limits**: `timeout_sec`. Failures → empty list.

## 11. Knowledge Graph Best-Child Picker

- **File**: [src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py](src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py) — `_llm_pick_best_child()` (~line 167).
- **Trigger**: during graph insertion, per fact, to place it under the best existing category. Background.
- **Model**: uses `picker_model` when passed through from `update_graph_from_dialogue` (daemon resolves it via `resolve_tool_router_model(cfg)` → small model when available). Falls back to `ollama_chat_model` when no small model is configured.
- **Inputs**: fact text + numbered list of candidate child nodes (name + description).
- **System prompt**: inline (~lines 156-161) — answer with number or `NONE`.
- **Output**: child node id or `None` (fact still inserted, just not under an optimal parent).

## 11b. Knowledge Graph Node Merge (rewrite-on-write consolidation)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py](src/jarvis/memory/graph_ops.py) — `merge_node_data()` (system prompt at `_MERGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
- **Trigger**: **once per (node, flush)** during `update_graph_from_dialogue`. The orchestrator first applies the exact-match dedupe fast-path, then groups the remaining facts by their resolved `node_id` so a 5-fact flush hitting the User node fires one rewrite, not five. Cold-start writes (empty target node) skip straight to plain append. Also invoked with `new_facts=[]` by the `consolidate_all_populated_nodes` maintenance op (powering the memory viewer's 🧹 button) to re-apply current rules to historical data.
- **Model**: same `picker_model` chain as #11 (small router model when configured, falls back to `ollama_chat_model`). Temperature 0 — the task is rule-following classification.
- **Inputs**: existing node `data` + the batch of new facts (zero or more) routed to that node in this flush.
- **System prompt**: defines an ordered rule set — contradiction/reversal drops the old version, near-duplicate phrasings collapse to one, repeated daily activities consolidate into patterns, independent attributes coexist (visible contradictions are NOT silently dropped), common-knowledge facts are pruned. Demands a bare `{"facts": [...]}` JSON object. Parser tries direct `json.loads` first, then a scoped regex (no greedy `\{.*\}`) before giving up.
- **Output**: `MergeResult(success: bool, incorporated_indices: list[int])`. The revised fact list is written back as the node's full `data`; `incorporated_indices` tells the orchestrator which inputs survived as new lines (under NFKC + casefold matching) so consolidated-out facts aren't reported as "newly stored". Subsumes per-flush supersession, near-duplicate dedupe, and ongoing consolidation in a single call. Because the latest prompt rewrites the whole node, updated conventions propagate to old data without a separate migration step.
- **Limits**: 20s timeout. **Hallucination guard**: rewrites with more than `len(existing) + len(new) + 2` lines are rejected as runaway output. Fail-open on any error, parse failure, oversized rewrite, or empty rewrite → caller falls back to plain `append_to_node` for each new fact so they still land (a contradiction is recoverable; a silent wipe or hallucinated bloat is not).

## 12. Task-list Planner (pre-flight decomposition, gates the whole turn)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/reply/planner.py](src/jarvis/reply/planner.py) — `plan_query()`.
- **Trigger**: once per reply, **after the tool router and before memory search**. Skipped when `cfg.planner_enabled = False`, when the query is shorter than `MIN_QUERY_CHARS` (4), or when no model / base URL is available.
- **Model / gating**: resolution chain `planner_model (override) → ollama_chat_model`. The planner tracks the chat model so upgrading the chat model (via setup wizard or config) automatically upgrades plan quality.
- **Inputs**: user query, dialogue context, **router-narrowed** tool catalogue (names + one-line descriptions) — not the full 30+ list. When the carry-over guard from #7 fires, the previous turn's failed tool name is unioned into this catalogue before the planner sees it, so the planner can plan a re-call without `toolSearchTool` round-tripping. **No** memory context — the planner decides *whether* memory is needed.
- **System prompt**: `_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `planner.py`. Teaches the `searchMemory topic='...'` directive for prior-conversation lookups, short imperative tool steps, angle-bracket entity placeholders, final synthesis step, same-language output, no numbering.
- **Output**: list of plan steps (max `MAX_STEPS` = 5). Gates memory enrichment (#3 / #4) and augments the tool router (#7 — planner's picks are unioned in, not replacing). Single-step `["Reply to the user."]` plans are the planner's positive "no memory, no tools" signal. An empty list is fail-open — the engine reverts to running #3 unconditionally. Consumed further by the engine to build the `ACTION PLAN:` system-message block and drive the direct-exec loop (#13) for small models.
- **Limits**: `planner_timeout_sec` (6s). Fail-open → `[]`.

## 13. Plan Step Resolver (per direct-exec turn, small models)

- **File**: [src/jarvis/reply/planner.py](src/jarvis/reply/planner.py) — `resolve_next_tool_call()`.
- **Trigger**: top of each agentic-loop iteration when `use_text_tools` is True AND the plan from #12 still has unexecuted tool steps. Runs instead of the chat model for that turn. **Fast path skips the LLM entirely** when the step is fully concrete (tool name + `key='value'` args, no `<placeholder>`); the LLM call only fires when entity substitution or key remapping is needed.
- **Model**: same chain as #12.
- **Inputs**: next planned step text, prior tool calls (name + args + result excerpt), per-turn tool schema.
- **System prompt**: `_STEP_RESOLVER_SYSTEM` at [planner.py:300](src/jarvis/reply/planner.py:300). Teaches one-JSON-object output, placeholder substitution from prior results, `null` for synthesis steps.
- **Output**: `(tool_name, arguments)` tuple or `None`. Unknown tool names are rejected via the allow-list guard.
- **Limits**: `planner_timeout_sec`. Fail-open → `None` (engine falls back to the chat-model turn).

## 14. Tool-specific LLM calls

- **Weather** ([src/jarvis/tools/builtin/weather.py](src/jarvis/tools/builtin/weather.py), ~line 60) — `ollama_chat_model`, parses location/time/unit from the query.
- **Nutrition log_meal** ([src/jarvis/tools/builtin/nutrition/log_meal.py](src/jarvis/tools/builtin/nutrition/log_meal.py), lines 48 & 136) — `ollama_chat_model`, extracts nutrients, confirms logging.

## Optimisation ideas (seed list)

1. Batch multi-chunk memory digests (#4) into a single call with explicit markers.
2. Parallelise multiple tool-result digests (#5) when several results land at once.
3. Pre-warm the intent-judge model before TTS finishes.
4. Cache tool-router (#7) output by query hash.
5. Give each digest its own timeout budget rather than sharing `llm_digest_timeout_sec` (today a slow memory digest can starve the max-turn digest).
6. Consider single-model deployments: router+planner prefer `intent_judge_model`; loading a second model hurts cold-start latency on small hardware.
7. Narrow `llm_thinking_enabled` to router/planner only, not every context.
8. Reduce `intent_judge_timeout_sec` (15s) or race it against text-based wake detection to avoid blocking the audio loop.

## Measuring

`tests/performance/test_pipeline_timings.py` times each context in this graph against a live Ollama. Run:

```
pytest tests/performance/ -v -m performance -s
```

It records per-context p50/p95 latencies using a monkey-patch recorder that infers the context from the caller's `__qualname__` (see `_CALLER_TO_CONTEXT` in `tests/performance/timing_recorder.py`). Dumps a JSON report to `tests/performance/reports/`. A micro-benchmark with a tiny fixed prompt runs alongside to give a per-call floor — if that floor moves, every context's total moves with it, so hardware/model drift is visible immediately.

Baseline on a local gemma4:e2b (as of 2026-04-22, 3 queries × 3 runs): main chat turn p50 ~4.5s, enrichment extract p50 ~0.9s (small-model chain), micro-prompt floor ~0.15s. Sample sizes: main 25 calls, enrichment 9. Use these as rough reference points — the assertions in the test are relative-shape (router ≤ 1.5× main chat turn), not absolute.

When you add or change a context, update `_CALLER_TO_CONTEXT` so it shows up in the report instead of landing in the `other:` bucket.

## Keep this doc in sync

This graph is the reference for LLM-latency optimisation. Treat it as authoritative: whenever code changes affect an LLM call — a new context, a removed one, a changed model/timeout/cap/gating/prompt source, or a new data-flow edge — update this file in the same PR. If the update would be more than a one-line tweak, reflect it in the relevant `*.spec.md` too.
