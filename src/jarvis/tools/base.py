        Implementation guideline:
        - Put all operational logic directly in the `run` method.
        - Keep helper functions module-level only when they provide clear reuse (e.g. nutrition
            extraction helpers used by multiple code paths / tests). Otherwise inline.
        - `run` receives validated args (per schema) and a `ToolContext` giving access to db, cfg,
            prompts, redacted_text, retry allowance, and a user_print callable.
