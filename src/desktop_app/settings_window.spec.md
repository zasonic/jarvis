# Settings Window Specification

Auto-generated settings UI that dynamically builds its interface from config field metadata.

## Overview

The Settings Window provides a graphical interface for editing `config.json` without requiring users to manually edit JSON. It reads the current config, presents categorised fields with appropriate input widgets, and saves changes back.

## Design Principles

1. **Metadata-driven**: All fields are defined in a `FIELD_METADATA` registry. Adding a new config parameter to the settings UI requires only adding a `FieldMeta` entry — no widget code changes.
2. **Minimal config files**: Only non-default values are written to `config.json`. Removing a field from the config reverts it to the default.
3. **Preserves unknown keys**: Keys not managed by the UI (e.g. `mcps`, `_config_version`, future additions) are preserved when saving.
4. **Theme-consistent**: Uses the shared Jarvis theme from `themes.py`.

## Architecture

```
FieldMeta (dataclass)
  ├── key: str           # config.json key name
  ├── label: str         # Human-readable label
  ├── description: str   # Tooltip text
  ├── category: str      # Tab grouping key
  ├── field_type: str    # "bool" | "int" | "float" | "str" | "choice" | "device" | "list"
  ├── choices            # For "choice"/"device": [(value, display), ...]
  ├── min_val / max_val  # Numeric bounds
  ├── step               # Increment step
  ├── suffix             # Unit label (e.g. "s", "ms", "WPM")
  └── nullable           # Whether None is valid (shows placeholder)
```

## Widget Mapping

| field_type | Widget | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `bool` | QCheckBox | |
| `int` | QSpinBox | With bounds, step, suffix |
| `int` (nullable) | QCheckBox + QSpinBox | Checkbox enables/disables the spinbox |
| `float` | QDoubleSpinBox | With bounds, step, suffix |
| `str` | QLineEdit | Placeholder if nullable |
| `choice` | QComboBox | Pre-defined options |
| `device` | QComboBox | Dynamically populated from sounddevice |
| `list` | QListWidget + Add/Edit/Remove buttons | Stores as JSON array in config |

## Layout

The settings window uses a sidebar navigation pattern: a fixed-width `QListWidget` on the left lists categories, and a `QStackedWidget` on the right shows the selected category's form. This avoids horizontal overflow from too many tabs.

## Categories (Sidebar Order)

1. LLM & AI Models
2. Text-to-Speech
3. Piper TTS
4. Chatterbox TTS
5. Sesame CSM TTS
6. Voice Input (includes microphone device selection)
7. Wake Word
8. Speech Recognition (Whisper)
9. Voice Activity Detection
10. Timing & Windows
11. Memory & Dialogue
12. Location
13. Features (includes Dictation Mode toggle and hotkey)
14. MCP Servers
15. Advanced

## Hardware Device Selection

The Voice Input tab includes a device dropdown populated at window open time via `sounddevice.query_devices()`. It lists all input-capable devices with their index and name. The stored value is the device index as a string, or empty string for system default.

## Save Behaviour

- Only keys that differ from `get_default_config()` are written.
- Existing keys not managed by the UI are preserved (e.g. `mcps`, `active_profiles`, `wake_aliases`, `allowlist_bundles`, `stop_commands`).
- After save, a dialog confirms success and reminds the user to restart.
- If the daemon is running when save completes, the tray app offers to restart it.

## Reset to Defaults

- Prompts for confirmation.
- Resets all widget values to `get_default_config()` values.
- Does NOT immediately save — user must still click Save.

## Integration

- Accessed via "⚙️ Settings" in the system tray menu.
- Opens as a modal QDialog.
- Lazy-imported to avoid loading sounddevice at startup.

## MCP Servers Section

The MCP Servers category is **not** metadata-driven — it uses a custom page because `mcps` is a complex dict structure.

### Layout

- Description label explaining what MCP servers are
- List widget showing configured servers (display name from catalogue if recognised, otherwise `🔌 {name}`)
- Buttons: **Add from Catalogue**, **Add Custom**, **Edit**, **Remove**
- Detail panel showing the selected server's name, command, args, and env vars

### Add from Catalogue

Opens `_MCPCatalogueDialog` showing all entries from `mcp_catalogue.CATALOGUE`. Already-configured servers appear checked and disabled. Servers that require an API key show a 🔑 badge. When the user confirms, they're prompted for any needed API keys.

### Add Custom

Opens `_MCPEditDialog` with fields for name, command, args (space-separated), and env vars (KEY=VALUE pairs). Validates that name and command are non-empty.

### Edit

Opens `_MCPEditDialog` pre-filled with the selected server's config. Name is read-only during edit.

### Remove

Prompts for confirmation, then removes the server from the in-memory dict.

### Save Behaviour

On save, the `mcps` dict is written to config.json if non-empty, or removed entirely if empty. On reset, all MCPs are cleared.

## Fields NOT Exposed in UI

These fields are managed elsewhere or are too complex for a simple form:

- `db_path` / `sqlite_vss_path` — internal storage paths
- `active_profiles` — list managed by setup wizard
- `allowlist_bundles` — list of bundle IDs
- `wake_aliases` — list of strings (complex editing)
- `stop_commands` / `stop_command_fuzzy_ratio` — list of strings
- `use_stdin` — developer/CLI flag
- `voice_debug` — environment variable only
- `whisper_min_audio_duration` / `whisper_min_word_length` — rarely changed advanced params
- `vad_frame_ms` / `vad_pre_roll_ms` — low-level VAD timing
