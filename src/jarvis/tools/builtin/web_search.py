    that title. Uses `lang.wikipedia.org` so the reply is in the user's
    spoken language when Whisper gave us a non-English code.

    We deliberately do NOT reuse the generic cascade fetcher: the REST
    summary API returns a curated `extract` field — short, clean, no
    navigation cruft — which is a better fit for the untrusted-extract
    fence than the full HTML page.

    `deadline` (monotonic timestamp) is forwarded to every request so a
    nearly-exhausted chain budget cannot be blown by tail latency in this
    branch. None means "use the default per-request timeout".
